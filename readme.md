The app copies the URL passed to it and then quits. It also registers itself as a browser.

The use-case is being able to quickly copy a URL by clicking it when using a “browser picker” app, like [Choosy](https://www.choosyosx.com). Since the app registers itself as a browser, it will show up as a browser in Choosy, and when selected, copies the URL to the clipboard.

The app copies the URL passed to it and then quits. It also registers itself as a browser.

The use-case is being able to quickly copy a URL by clicking it when using a browser picker app like [Velja](https://sindresorhus.com/velja). Since the app registers itself as a browser, it will show up as a browser in the Velja browser prompt, and when selected, copies the URL to the clipboard.
